HTML supports various image file formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG etc. The choice of format depends on your needs.

## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

Whenever you have many different colors in pictures you should use a JPEG.

```

- **The JPEG is best for**: Photographs, images with gradients, and complex scenes.
- **Advantages:** High compression, small file sizes, and good image quality for photographs.
- **Considerations:** Lossy compression, not suitable for images with transparency.

## PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

```image-layout-a
![[Cartoon Globe - 2000x2000.png]]
![[League of Legends Logo - 3331x2160.png]]
```

- **PNG is best for:** Images with transparency, icons, logos, and graphics with sharp edges.
- **Advantages of using PNG:** Supports both lossless and lossy compression, excellent image quality, and transparency.
- **Considerations:** Larger file sizes for complex images compared to **JPEG**.

## GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

Use GIF when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color and also for simple animations.

```image-layout-masonry-4
![[procedural-generation-11379.gif]]
![[character-13952.gif]]
![[boat-14509.gif]]
![[dna-1532.gif]]
```

- **GIFs are best for**: Simple animations, images with limited color palette, and icons.
- **Advantages of GIFs:** Supports animations, transparency, and small file sizes for simple graphics
- **Considerations:** Limited color support (256 colors), not suitable for photographs or complex images.

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

```image-layout-masonry-4
![[business-svgrepo-com.svg]]
![[user-svgrepo-com.svg]]
![[pie-chart-svgrepo-com.svg]]
![[accelerate-svgrepo-com.svg]]
```

- **SVG are best for:** Vector graphics, logos, icons, and images that need to scale without loss of quality.
- **Advantages of using SVGs:** Resolution-independent, small file sizes, and sharp rendering ay any size.
- **Considerations:** Not suitable for complex photographic images.
