          Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
          desk, lying between the copies of <i>nature</i>, <i>new scientist</i>,
          and all the other scientific journals her work had aeared in, was a
          well thumbed copy of <cite>on the road</cite>. It had been Molly's
          favourite book since collage, and the longer she spent in these four
          walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

          She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting a under s
          poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
          <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing bettwe to do</q>.
          Although many considered her pioneering workm unraveling the secrets
          of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucletic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
          outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something
          bettwe to do.
