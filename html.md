# HTML 5 - Hypertext Markup Language 5

![[html.svg]]

HTML is a markup language that is used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the **World Wide Web** (www). 

The HTML is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets and these angled brackets are called HTML elements. These HTML elements are usually made up of two tags, *an opening tag* and a *closing tag*

```html
<p>  <!-- opening tag -->
</p> <!-- closing tag -->
```

Each Element tells the browser what kind of information sits between an opening and a closing tag. For example:

1. `<html>` tag tells the browser that anything between it and the closing `</html>` tag is **HTML** code.
2. `<p>` tag tells the browser that text sitting in-between the opening `<p>` and the closing `</p>` tag is a paragraph.

In addition to this, HTML elements use attributes to tell the browser additional information about them.

[Attributes](def/attributes.md) are made up of two parts, *a name* and a *value* separated by an equal sign. This is the syntax:

```html
<html lang="en"> 
</html>
```

- *name* → `lang` which stands for Language
- *value* → `en` which stands for English
