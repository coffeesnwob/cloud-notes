# Semantic Markup

Semantic Markup provides extra information; using HTML tags that provides extra information and meaning or purpose of the content within them rather than just defining its appearance.

## strong and emphasis

If you want to make text appear or indicate that it is important you use the `<strong>` element. By default, the text will appear bold.

```html
<p>
  <strong>Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in this area. Make sure that you
  guard your belongs with care.
</p>
```

The `<em>` element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of the sentence and by default, text will appear italic.

```html
<p>
  This is a normal sentence. This is a sentence with <em>emphasized text</em>.
</p>
```
