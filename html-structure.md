# HTML Structure

To tell the browser which version of **HTML** the page is using, you must include **DOCTYPE** declaration at the top of your page.

```html
<!-- declaration for html5  -->
<!doctype html>
```

## title

- `<titile>`: the contents of the title element is shown either in the top of the browser or on the tab for that page.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="The structure of html" />
    <meta name="author" content="LadyVim" />
    <title>Title of the page goes here</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the body of the page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
