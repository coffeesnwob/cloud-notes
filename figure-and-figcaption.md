# Figure and Figure Caption

Whenever you want to include a picture in your web page, you must place the `<img>` element inside `<figure>` element. The `<figure>` element is used to contain images and their caption using the `<figcaption>` which adds caption to an image.

The syntax:

```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="images/red-car.jpg"
    alt="Red sports car"
    title="Red supra 4gt crusing in the highway"
    width="250"
    height="300"
  />
  <figcaption>Supra's new model</figcaption>
</figure>
```
